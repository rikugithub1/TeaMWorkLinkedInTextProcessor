Meet Augusto Almeida, a Sao Paulo-based intern on our legal trade & logistics operation team. The team is responsible for ensuring we stay compliant with all global trade regulations, and Augusto plays an important role in this process. “I help manage the logistical and legal procedures for Brazil’s trade processes,” Augusto explained. “I also conduct trade-related legal research for 15 countries in Latin America.” Outside of his core role, Augusto is also involved in a variety of initiatives and employee resource groups across Google. “I’m passionate about youth empowerment, Black leadership, and diversity, equity, and inclusion,” he stated. “I participate in groups such as Movimiento AntiRacista (an organization for Black+ Googlers and interns in Latin America), Greenglers (a community of Googlers interested in sustainability), and AfroGooglers.”

Thank you for your work and contributions to #LifeatGoogle, Augusto!

“As a first-generation college student, I didn't know much about picking my major. However, I knew that I wanted to make a difference and work on something that matters. After taking my second programming course in college, I realized how much impact I could have through technology. Through researching this career path, I decided that product management would be a great fit for my personality and goals.” That’s Cassandra Marshall, an associate product management intern based in our Zurich, Switzerland office.

This summer, Cassandra is working on our YouTube Shopping team. More specifically, she’s creating a two-year strategy to help viewers discover and engage with shopping content on the site’s homepage. When asked for advice for anyone interested in doing similar work, Cassandra recommended: "Learn from leaders in the industry. Reading books about technology, business strategy, and computer science — plus listening to podcasts and interviews — really helped me develop my product sense.”

Welcome to #LifeatGoogle Cassandra — enjoy the rest of your internship!

Today marks Juneteenth, also known as Emancipation Day. On this day, June 19th, 1865, General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas and informed Black people that the Civil War was finally won, and they were free. Though the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed more than two years earlier, this declaration by Granger effectively ended slavery for 250,000 Black people in Texas and beyond.

For me, Juneteenth is both celebratory and heavy. I take time to reflect on how far we have come and how far we’ve yet to go. Because the end of slavery brought with it the Jim Crow South, redlining, systemic racial discrimination, white supremacy, and violence, its long-term legacy persists.

As leaders, we must continue to provide spaces where our employees feel safe bringing their authentic selves to work. At Google, we work hard to ensure Googlers have the resources and support they need to show up for themselves, their communities and each other, especially when times get tough. We necessitate inclusive hiring, enable tough conversations, and honor different perspectives.

On Juneteenth, let’s take time to celebrate the resilience of the Black community, look ahead, and create new legacies around providing safe and equitable spaces, feelings of belonging, and social justice.

For more on the history and legacy of Juneteenth check out our Google Arts and Culture Hub: https://lnkd.in/ex3c_5fg

On this day in 1865, now honored as #Juneteenth, news of freedom was finally delivered to enslaved Black Americans in Galveston Bay, TX. This past week the Black Googler Network (BGN) and partnering teams/employee resource groups brought together a global community of Googlers to share personal narratives, discussions with thought leaders, and highlight the ways in which Googlers are actively promoting product inclusion throughout the company.

Today’s Juneteenth #GoogleDoodle was created by guest artist, Laura Freeman, to honor generations of Black communities and celebrate freedom and perseverance. Learn more about her process below.

Last month was Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, and the Google Play team celebrated by highlighting creators of Asian and Pacific Islander (API) descent. While this effort involved many Googlers, we sat down with Adriana Kim — a Mountain View-based Merchandising Lead — to learn more about the project. “We worked closely with the Asian Googler Network and the Play Advisory Board to ensure their theme of “Emerging Undivided” was accurately interpreted in our art and copy,” Adriana explained. “This is why we used bold patterns, colors and textures inspired by food, art, fashion and architecture. These come together to create a mosaic of diversity that represents the many ways API cultures complement each other when united.”

When asked about the most rewarding part of this work, Adriana spoke about the power of representation. “The opportunity to amplify the voices of Asian Pacific individuals who may have been historically overlooked was particularly meaningful to me. By providing a platform for their stories, experiences, and perspectives, the campaign helped bring attention to their contributions and promoted inclusivity.”

Thank you for your contributions to #LifeatGoogle Adriana!

Meet Emma Ausman, a software engineering intern based in our Mountain View headquarters! This summer, Emma — a computer science student at Brigham Young University — is interning on the Google Assistant UI team. More specifically, she’s focused on improving visual components to create a more consistent user interface across Google Assistant. When asked about her path to becoming a Google intern, Emma mentioned a fun fact: this isn’t her first summer experience at Google! “I initially found out about Google’s internship program when I participated in the Computer Science Summer Institute way back in 2020,” she explained. “Afterwards, my dad encouraged me to apply for a full internship even though I didn't think I would receive an offer. The rest was history!”

Welcome (back) to #LifeatGoogle Emma, we hope you have a wonderful summer! Stay tuned to learn more about our 2023 #GoogleInterns

At Google, we want to surface helpful information for people when they are dealing to the effects of climate change.

As smoke from the Canadian wildfires continues to saturate skies in the Northeast of the US, we know that people are looking for more information about air quality.

Maps: By working with trusted data from the EPA and others, we are able to surface a dedicated air quality layers on the Google Maps app that shows you the air quality index (AQI). To add the air quality layer to your map, simply tap on the layers button in the top right corner of your screen, then select Air Quality under Map details.

Search: When you search for information about air quality on Google Search, for example ‘air quality near me’ you can see dedicated features with air quality information also from authoritative data partners like the EPA.

My number-one passion is to deliver best-in-class technology, and I will do whatever it takes to make a difference on my team. Throughout my career, I’ve learned the power of prioritizing problems over positions. My advice to women charting their careers is to focus less on titles, levels and positions, and to care deeply about the work. Titles are short-term, but passions will lead you forward in the long haul.

As we continue celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, we spoke with the Google Arts and Culture team to learn more about their work to spotlight Asian and Pacific Islander (API) art, histories, and communities. This year, the team partnered with the Asia Art Archive in America to highlight the practice of archiving Asian American artwork and book art. “When we were doing research for potential partnerships, the Asia Art Archive kept coming up as an organization that is doing amazing work,” explained Surya Tubach, a program manager at Google Arts & Culture. “They’re really trying to address the complexities in the contemporary Asian diaspora.” Visit the Asian Pacific American Cultures hub to learn more about our work with the Asia Art Archive, the Asian Art Museum, and countless other API-focused organizations → https://goo.gle/3IGl8aA

Happy Global Accessibility Awareness Day! To celebrate, we met with the Google Lookout team to learn more about their work to make the visual world more accessible. Originally launched in 2019, Lookout allows people who are blind or have low vision to use their camera to help identify objects in their surroundings. Now, the team is excited to announce image question and answer: a new feature that will use AI to process images, provide more detailed descriptions, and answer follow up questions. “I think there’s a ton of potential here… We’re helping give people tools to exercise agency, and this will give people more choice in their everyday lives,” explained Jerry Robinson, a UX Researcher on the team.

One major conclusion from #GoogleIO? Women are changing the world of tech. Here are our top takeaways from our Women In Leadership panel. ⤵️

👯‍♀️ Cultivating a strong workplace culture

When faced with uncertainty in the workplace, Maggie Johnson’s advice is to “Distinguish what you have control over and what you don’t. Help everyone on the team be there for each other and support each other. You can control that.”

🏖️ Balancing life and work

“Own your work-life balance.” - Prachi Gupta

Gupta says setting boundaries and carving out time for yourself can help you manage your time and your responsibilities much better.

📚 Skills and qualities essential in leadership

“I believe that we’ll need to be able to navigate ambiguity and get comfortable with that. Curiosity and empathy are two things that we’ll need to embrace and hold onto.” - Melonie Parker

Patricia Correa touched on the importance of "making decisions without consensus."

🌐 Preparing for the future

Shanika Hope, PhD’s advice for preparing for the future is, “You don’t have to have all the answers. You cannot do it alone. Ask questions. You must be willing to raise your hand and ask for help.”

What role do you play in the future of tech? It's all about preparing for the next generation of tech leadership.

#googleio is one of my favorite times of the year, but this year was especially magical. I'm walking away feeling more inspired and excited for the future of #womenintech

Why? This year, we brought more than 300 Women Techmakers Ambassadors, Google Developer Experts, Google Developer Groups (GDG) and Google Developer Student Clubs to celebrate and learn together - the largest group of developers at Google I/O. Being in a big room with the most supportive, energetic and empowered group of women and non-binary developers is an experience I will never forget.

I was humbled and amazed to hear their stories and the ways that being a #WTMAmbassador has impacted their careers and their lives. It is one of the best feelings to be able to see how the work you've been doing for the past 4+ years has impacted this incredible community.

A few highlights from the special day of programming at Google I/O:
🤖 Getting hands-on experience with the newly announced tools from Google ML
👩🏽‍💻 Learning gems from women in leadership on a panel led by Director, Education for Social Impact, Shanika Hope, PhD featuring senior leaders across Google
🌐 Watching the Google keynote surrounded by amazing women developers
☀️ Seeing #WTMAmbassadors shine as leaders, which you can learn more about here → https://goo.gle/42IgXU7

Events like these create a space for women to network, discuss the latest tech news, and learn alongside each other, and are crucial to our mission of building a world where all women thrive in tech.

Today we announced a new generative AI experience in search.

The way people search for information has transformed completely over the past few decades, and we’re once again at a time of evolution with #generativeAI.

AI has powered our Search Ads and the Search experience for years, but it’s exciting to see how generative AI will continue to improve and evolve the way people engage with information and the way advertisers are able to reach potential customers. https://lnkd.in/gA_ASGmc

So proud of the many teams working on this. It's inspiring and exciting to see everyone moving quickly, testing, learning and bringing products to life that will supercharge search.

More to come on our end - stay tuned for Google Marketing Live!

Super excited to share that today we took a first step toward a new era of online shopping. At #GoogleIO, we announced how we are supercharging shopping on Search by combining the power of generative AI with Google’s Shopping Graph to make even the most complex purchase decisions faster & easier.

This new experience takes the heavy lifting out of online shopping, summarizing insights from 35 billion listings to give you the most accurate and up-to-date snapshot on products and brands to consider. It’s like having an objective and knowledgeable personal shopper at your fingertips.

Congratulations to the team for building this delightful experience with the commerce ecosystem at the center!!

Today, following recent improvements in math and logic, we’re updating Bard with the ability to help people with programming and software development tasks.

We’re launching these capabilities in 20+ programming languages. including C++, Go, Java, Javascript, Python and Typescript. https://lnkd.in/gnRjeMG3

Now, Bard can summarize and explain snippets of code for you and you can easily export Python code to Google Colab — no copy and paste required.

Bard can also help you write functions for Google Sheets.

If you run into errors, Bard can help you debug code, too.

I’m excited to see new ways people use Bard to support their coding and data interests. As always, keep the feedback coming as we continue to make updates. bard.google.com

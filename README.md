# TeaMWork LinkedIn Post Text Processor 
This is a small-scale text processor for LinkedIn posts that I built to complete my task efficiently in the TeaMWork program.

Given a few samples of data, I used regex to filter the necessary lines to extract useful information and displayed on a localhost browser hosted using Flask.

It also has a function that uses OpenAI framework to suggest the most suitable theme for each post, which is currently unused but is for future reference.
